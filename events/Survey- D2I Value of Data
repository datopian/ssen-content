Scottish & Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) is carrying out research to determine the wider value created
by making the network’s energy data open to all (e.g. through the SSEN Distribution Data Portal, the SSEN Transmission Open Data Portal, and the Near Real-time Data Access (NeRDA) Portal)s 

As part of this research, we are keen to hear from different types of stakeholder and energy data user and get your 
views on how SSEN’s open data helps to create value for you. We would be very grateful if you could answer this online survey, which will take no more than 5 minutes to complete.
