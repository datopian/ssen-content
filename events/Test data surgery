Following the success of our first Data Surgery, we’re excited to announce the next online session where the Data Sharing team will dive deep into the Long Term Development Statements available on our Data Portal.
This virtual session will focus on the Long Term Development Statements, giving you — as a valued data portal user — the opportunity to engage directly with our internal SSEN Distribution teams. 
It’s your chance to ask questions, discuss, and provide valuable feedback to help shape the future of the data we share.
