The Data Sharing Team is delighted to invite you to the return of our Smart Meter Data Surgery!
It’s been a year since we hosted our very first session exploring the Smart Meter data available on our Data Portal and we’re excited to share how things have progressed since then.

In this follow-up session, we’ll:

Recap the key highlights and takeaways from our first Data Surgery
Showcase the latest updates, improvements, and enhancements made over the past 12 months
Look ahead to what’s next for Smart Meter data and how you can be involved

This virtual, interactive session is designed to give you, our valued data portal users the opportunity to:

Engage directly with our internal teams
Ask questions and share your perspectives
Provide feedback that will help shape the future of the data we share
