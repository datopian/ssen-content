We are pleased to invite interested stakeholders to the workshop "Towards a Transport Data Commons - Making High Quality Transport Data Accessible" on March 17, 2023, 9:00 am - 12:30 pm (UTC-4) at the headquarters of the World Bank in Washington, DC (Room MC2-800). The workshop will provide a platform to inform interested individuals and organizations about what happened and how they can participate and engage with the Transport Data Commons. In addition, we would like to take a closer look at how to open up and share data, in particular when it comes to development banks and international organizations.
