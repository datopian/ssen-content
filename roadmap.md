> This roadmap is a living document and may evolve based on market and data consumer feedback and internal strategy shifts.

## Purpose of Roadmap

**The SSEN Data Roadmap serves as the strategic plan outlining the key milestones related to data provision and management. It provides a structured path for implementing data sets and achieving data strategy goals.**

The Data Roadmap promotes open collaboration and transparent data sharing with stakeholders. By outlining clear milestones and objectives, it creates a shared vision with stakeholders which encourages active involvement and feedback, where insights and requirements can be openly addressed. This ensures stakeholders are well informed about the data journey, promoting trust and cooperation in achieving common data-related goals.

## How did we come up with the roadmap?

**The Data Roadmap was created looking at 5 main areas:**

- Retrospective â€“ what existing data does SSEN have that stakeholders would benefit from?
- Prospective â€“ what data is SSEN going to produce in the near term  that stakeholders would benefit from?
- Stakeholder requests/feedback â€“ obtained through direct requests via the data portal as well as stakeholder feedback from surveys, roundtables, etc 
- Legal requirements â€“ e.g., from a regulatory standpoint 
- Future looking â€“ what are customers or partners asking for in the future?

## How will we continue to engage stakeholders moving forward?

- Regular Updates â€“ provide consistent and transparent updates on the progress of the data roadmap. Visualised reports will be used to present data roadmap progress, what has been published and what is to come 
- Feedback mechanismsâ€“ we will continue to collect stakeholder feedback from our feedback form on the data portal as well as through stakeholder surveys and other dedicated channels. We will act on the feedback in a  timely manner to demonstrate responsiveness and adaptability 
- Stakeholder Forums â€“ we are creaating forums and discussion groups on the data portal where stakeholders can share their perspectives and ideas on the data roadmap and what they would like to see included, fostering a sense of shared ownership
- Providing tailored information to stakeholders-  use cases and the target audience for all data sets are included with the data sets based on interest and relevance to various stakeholder groups 
- Accessibility  â€“ ensure that information about the data roadmap is easily accessible to all stakeholders to support understanding and engagement through the use of appropriate documentation e.g video demonstrations, etc
- Demonstrate value â€“ highlight the value generated from completed phases of the roadmap, showing tangible benefits e.g improved data accessibility, etc which will be shown through our regular updates on our Digital Action Plan.

## How does the roadmap link to the Digital Strategy and Action Plan?

As mentioned in our [Digital Strategy](https://www.ssen.co.uk/about-ssen/digital-strategy/our-digital-strategy/), our role in the future energy system is driven by Digital and Data. The move to a flexible, decentralised energy system would not be possible without making our systems  and processes more digital and improving our ability to use and share data.  Hence, our Data portal and Data Roadmap are imperative. We have created the Data Roadmap as a forward looking view of our data as we aim to share data in an open and transparent way and want to gain feedback on what's to come as we want to ensure our portal has the right data our stakeholders want, to a quality they want, and ensure we are improving how we think about and handle data within our business.

Our Digital strategy sits alongside our [Digital Action Plan](https://www.ssen.co.uk/about-ssen/digital-strategy/our-digital-action-plan/), which we update every 
6 months and gives you the detail on when we will deliver our products and services and how we will be measured on their performance. Therefore, you will be able to see regular updates on how we are delivering our Data Portal and Data Roadmap as well as the value they have generated.
