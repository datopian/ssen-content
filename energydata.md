#  ‚ö° **Looking for energy data?**  
 This page brings together a curated list of data portals across the UK energy industry, covering electricity, gas, market, and research data. Whether you're a data analyst, innovator, policymaker, academic, or curious citizen, these portals offer direct access to high-quality, authoritative datasets that can inform decision-making, enable innovation, support investment planning, and drive sustainability initiatives.

If you can't find the dataset you're looking for here, many of these portals also signpost to related sources, sector-specific platforms, and open data initiatives. We recommend exploring their "Resources," "Links," or "About" sections to uncover further datasets, collaborative projects, and tools across the wider energy data ecosystem. By connecting to these data sources, users can gain deeper insights into the UK‚Äôs energy system, support energy transition efforts, and contribute to smarter, more transparent, and efficient solutions for the future.
