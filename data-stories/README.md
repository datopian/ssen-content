# Blog- Smart Meter Data Surgery


Data is a precious commodity in 21st century life. At SSEN we take our role as guardians of information on energy use very seriously, but we also are keen to explore the potential insights it can offer, and the benefits that are already being delivered as a result. 

Smart Meter data is of particular interest.
Around one year ago, SSEN became the first Distribution Network Operator (DNO) to publish our full smart meter half-hourly consumption datasets.

The data is aggregated at the most granular level to give network level visibility, maximising its usefulness to us in the energy sector and also other groups, whilst also protecting individual consumer privacy. 

We made this aggregated data available for everyone through our specially developed Open Data Portal.

Having made this data accessible, we then addressed what else we could do to harness its value. 

That’s where our Data Surgeries came in. We decided to hold these events to conduct ‘deep dives’ into the data assets we have put on the portal. This means we can help boost the knowledge and confidence of people who are keen to use our data, while also learning more about how it’s being employed.


## Smart Meter Data Surgery 
### The first surgery we held focused specifically on smart meter data, and sought to explain:

  •	What a smart meter can do
  
  •	How we use the data it produces 

  •	Other common uses for smart meter data 

  •	Future plans for its use. 


  

The event gave us great insights too, as we gained a better understanding of how our customers are already using the data on our portal. Knowing this means we can tailor what we offer to improve what we provide on the portal. 

### Here’s an overview of the benefits that have already arisen from our first smart meter data surgery.

•	We have gained a better understanding of what the data is telling us.

•	We’ve given customers a better understanding of how they can use the data. 

•	We were able to get a good sense of the extent of engagement with - and understanding of - the data we provide. 

•	We got useful user feedback which will help us make further improvements. 

The ability to talk directly to our users at the surgery was very useful. The nature of working with data means it risks being impersonal at times, but the surgery cut through this, with many valuable conversations between us and our users. And now these links have been forged, our users know how they can get in touch with us if they have questions or suggestions.
The feedback after the session spoke for itself, with attendees describing it as “really helpful”, and offering a “great walkthrough” of the portal, that was referred to as being “super useful”. 

We’ve got over 1.8 million smart meters in our north and south licence areas recording the active and reactive half hourly consumption - that equates to over 170 million readings per day. This volume of data will only increase as the nationwide smart meter rollout continues. 

It’s our role as a custodian of this data to balance our responsibility to treat it sensitively, while also unlocking the great insights it can provide. This information is already telling us vital things about levels of energy use, usage patterns, and hitherto unseen trends.

Smart meter data plays a key role in supporting a cost-effective and efficient transition to net zero. As we decarbonise heat and transport and move towards low carbon technologies, having more knowledge of current demand on the electricity network will help identify new opportunities for low carbon technologies, longer-term network reinforcement, and the short-term deployment of flexibility.

Our first data surgeries have amplified these benefits for our customers, and emboldened by the success of these early events, we look forward to welcoming more of you to the data surgeries we’ll hold in the future.

### We also asked, how confident our users felt using our portal at the start of the session and the end of the session, here are the results!
